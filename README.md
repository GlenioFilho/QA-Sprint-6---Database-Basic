QA Sprint 6 - Database Basics
🛠️ Project Description
In Sprint 6, we focused on the basics of databases. We learned how to interact with databases using SQL (Structured Query Language), and explored how to work with data using command-line tools. The goal was to understand how databases store and manage data, and how we can retrieve, update, and manipulate that data efficiently.

We also learned how to manage files and directories through the command-line interface (CLI), which is essential for working with databases and SQL queries.

🎯 Objective
The goal of this sprint was to:

Understand the basics of using the console to work with databases.

Learn the SQL language to perform tasks like querying, updating, and deleting data.

Understand relationships between tables and how to use JOINs to combine data from multiple tables.

Gain hands-on experience working with databases using the command line.

🚀 Tools Used

Console/Command Line: Used for interacting with the system and connecting to remote servers.

SQL: Used to manage and query databases.

Database Server: Local or remote server for practicing SQL commands and testing queries.

📝 Key Tasks and Workflow

Console Basics:

Learn how to use the command line to navigate the system and manage files.

Understand how to connect to remote servers and work with directories.

Learn how to copy, move, and filter files, which is useful when managing SQL scripts or data backups.

Introduction to SQL:

Understand the basics of SQL and how to perform database testing.

Create your first SQL statements to interact with databases.

Learn about relational databases, where data is stored in tables.

Explore SQL queries to slice and retrieve data.

Work with aggregate functions to summarize data (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG).

Practice data type conversion within SQL queries.

Advanced SQL Features:

Learn how to group and sort data in SQL queries.

Understand how to modify data using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands.

Explore how to backup (dump) and restore databases.

Table Relationships in SQL:

Learn about relationships between tables in a relational database.

Understand different types of relationships: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN.

Practice searching for empty values and retrieving data using multiple tables.

Work with ER diagrams to visualize table relationships and understand how to structure data.

Sprint 6 Project:

Complete a practical project where you will apply what you learned to work with databases and SQL.

Submit your project to show your understanding of database concepts and SQL queries.

Congratulations on mastering database fundamentals!
